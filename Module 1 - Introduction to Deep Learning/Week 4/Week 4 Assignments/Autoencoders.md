# Autoencoders.ipynb
> 
> _Warning! This assignment requires **several hours** of computation, because it contains training of a real world neural network architecture on a CPU, which we think is essential for learning deep learning. We recommend to use offline instructions at the bottom to setup your own environment (Docker or Anaconda). If it's not an option, you can proceed with Coursera Notebooks, but do expect kernel interruptions. In the meantime we're adding model checkpointing to our tasks, this should help to continue from where you left off. We think the time to setup your own environment is worth the comfort throughout the course._
